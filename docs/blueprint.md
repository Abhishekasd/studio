# **App Name**: MorningMuse3D

## Core Features:

- Language Selection: Users choose their preferred language via a floating 3D dropdown or globe selector. All messages and UI elements adapt to the selected language.
- Message Categories: Each category (Shayari, Joke, Motivational, Spiritual) generates morning-themed content with relevant emojis. Includes emoji enrichment
- Message Generation Logic: Every message is unique per session and never repeats. Backend tracks previously shown messages per user/device.
- Copy Button: Copies the message to clipboard with a 3D sparkle or bounce animation.
- Image Generator: Creates a stylized image with the message embedded and a Morning Muse watermark. The LLM is a tool, and can use its reasoning ability to subtly and artistically incorporate the watermark and/or to modify the presentation.
- Show Another: Replaces the current message with a new one from the same category using smooth 3D transitions (e.g., card flip, cube rotation).
